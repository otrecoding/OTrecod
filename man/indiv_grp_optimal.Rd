A. THE RECODING PROBLEM IN DATA FUSION

Assuming that \eqn{Y} and \eqn{Z} are two target variables which refered to the same target population in two separate databases A and B respectively (no overlapping rows),
so that \eqn{Y} and \eqn{Z} are never jointly observed. Assuming also that A and B share a subset of common covariates \eqn{X} of any types (same encodings in A and B)
completed or not. Merging these two databases often requires to solve a recoding problem by creating an unique database where
the missing information of \eqn{Y} and \eqn{Z} is fully completed.


B. DESCRIPTION OF THE FUNCTION

The function \code{indiv_grp_optimal} is an intermediate function used in the implementation of an algorithm called \code{OUTCOME} (and its enrichment \code{R-OUTCOME} (2)) dedicated to the solving of recoding problems in data fusion using Optimal Transportation theory.
The model is implemented in the function \code{\link{OT_outcome}} which integrates the function \code{indiv_grp_optimal} in its syntax as a possible second step of the algorithm.
The function \code{indiv_grp_optimal} can nevertheless be used separately providing that the argument \code{proxim} receives an output object of the function \code{\link{proxim_dist}}.
This latter is available in the package and is so directly usable beforehand.

The function \code{indiv_grp_optimal} constitutes an alternative method to the nearest neighbor procedure implemented in the function \code{\link{indiv_grp_closest}}.
As for the function \code{\link{indiv_grp_closest}}, assuming that the objective consists in the prediction of \eqn{Z} in the database A, the first step of the algorithm related to \code{OUTCOME} provides an estimate of \eqn{\gamma}, the solution of the optimization problem, which can be seen, in this case as an estimation of the joint distribution \eqn{(Y,Z)} in A.
Rather than using a nearest neighbor approach to provide individual predictions, the function \code{indiv_grp_optimal} solves an optimization problem using the simplex algorithm which searches for the individual predictions of \eqn{Z} that minimize the computed total distance satisfying the joint probability distribution estimated in the first part.
More details about the theory related to the solving of this optimization problem is described in the section 5.3 of (2).

Obviously, this algorithm  runs in the same way for the prediction of \eqn{Y} in the database B.
The function \code{indiv_grp_optimal} integrates in its syntax the function \code{\link{avg_dist_closest}} and the related argument \code{percent_closest} is identical in the two functions.
Thus, when computing average distances between an individual i and a subset of individuals assigned to a same level of \eqn{Y} or \eqn{Z} is required, user can decide if all individuals from the subset of interest can participate to the computation (\code{percent_closest = 1}) or only a fixed part p (<1) corresponding to the closest neighbors of i (in this case \code{percent_closest} = p).

The arguments \code{jointprobaA} and \code{jointprobaB} can be seen as estimations of \eqn{\gamma} (sum of cells must be equal to 1) that correspond to estimations of the joint distributions of \eqn{(Y,Z)} in A and B respectively.

The argument \code{solvr} permits user to choose the solver of the optimization algorithm. The default solver is "glpk" that corresponds to the GNU Linear Programming Kit (see (3) for more details). The solver "clp" (see (4)) for Coin-or Linear Programming, convenient in linear and quadratic situations, is also directly integrated in the function.
Moreover, the function actually uses the \code{R} optimization infrastructure of the package \pkg{ROI} which offers a wide choice of solver to users by easily loading the associated plugins of \pkg{ROI} (see (5)).

### Example using The Euclidean distance on a complete database
# For this example we keep only 200 rows:

data(tab_test)
tab_test2 <- tab_test[c(1:80, 5001:5080), ]
dim(tab_test2)

# Adding NAs in Y1 and Y2
tab_test2[tab_test2$ident == 2, 2] <- NA
tab_test2[tab_test2$ident == 1, 3] <- NA

# Because all covariates are ordered in numeric form,
# the transfo_dist function is not required here

res3 <- proxim_dist(tab_test2, norm = "M")

#' ### Y(Y1) and Z(Y2) are a same variable encoded in 2 different forms:
### 4 levels for Y1 and 3 levels for Y2
### ... Stored in two distinct databases, A and B, respectively
### The marginal distribution of Y in B is unknown,
### as the marginal distribution of Z in A ...

# Assuming that the following matrix called transport symbolizes
# an estimation of the joint distribution L(Y,Z) ...
# Note that, in reality this distribution is UNKNOWN and is
# estimated in the OT function by resolving the optimization problem.

# By supposing:

val_trans <- c(0.275, 0.115, 0, 0, 0, 0.085, 0.165, 0, 0, 0, 0.095, 0.265)
transport2 <- matrix(val_trans, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)

# Getting the individual predictions of Z in A (only)
# by computing average distances on 90\% of the nearest neighbors of
# each modality of Z in B
res4 <- indiv_grp_optimal(res3,
  jointprobaA = transport2,
  jointprobaB = transport2, percent_closest = 0.90,
  which.DB = "A"
